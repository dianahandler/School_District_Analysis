# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to manipulate school grade data collected across various high schools because it is believed that there has been academic dishonesty among math and reading grades from Thomas High School. Thus THS math and reading grades were changed to NaNs. The school analysis was then repeated to visualize any impact this data manipulation may have caused.
## Results
