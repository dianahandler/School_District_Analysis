# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this challenge was to manipulate school grade data collected across various high schools because it is believed that there has been academic dishonesty among math and reading grades from Thomas High School. Thus THS math and reading grades were changed to NaNs. The school analysis was then repeated to visualize any impact this data manipulation may have caused.
## Results
The following questions will be addressed
- How is the district summary affected?
- How is the school summary affected?
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following
  -  math and reading scores by grade
  -  scores by school spending
  -  scores by school size
  -  scores by school type
### How is the district summary affected?
The district summary changes are small but visible in our analyses. Below is our district summary before and after our data manipulation.

While there is not a noticeable difference among the average math and reading scores, we can see a small change in our "% passing math," "% passing reading," and "% overall passing." 

### How is the school summary affected?
   The changes appear to be very minimal when comparing the average reading and math scores.
